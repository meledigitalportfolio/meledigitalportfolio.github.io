    <h1> My Art </h1>
    <h4> Hi! Welcome to my art page! Up until 2019, I was only drawing with pencil. I was practicing shading, and while it was very fun, it got boring. Now that I've switched to pen, I can design t-shirts, I can draw on waterbottles, etc. I've even started drawing on my door and bathroom!  </h4>
    
    <h4> Here are some some of the art pieces I have been working on:</h4>
