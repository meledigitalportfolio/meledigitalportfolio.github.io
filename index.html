    <p> Hi! Welcome to my homepage! Here you can learn all about me and the things I am doing both inside and outside of school!! I love school, my family, drawing, baking, my dog, and to fence! </p>
         
    
    
    
         
         
    <h3> Enjoy! </h3>

      
     
      
      <h2> My Stretch</h2>
      <h4> This year, my stretch was to learn more vocabulary. And my strength was taking good notes. It has helped me a lot. Especially on essays. Also, my notes for Literature has helped me to study for upcoming tests, as I took a lot of notes while we were reading. I also have a feeling that my notes from History will help me later, as it is required that a highschooler takes US History. And if I am ever confused, I can just look back at my notes! </h4>
      
    
      <h2> My Strength </h2>
<h4> My stretch was learning more vocabulary words everyday. learn three vocabulary words every day. It did take me a while to find an efficient way to memorize words, but now, I've got that down! This week I have memorized prodigal, voltile, vindicate, and zealot! </h4>
      
      
      <h2> My Goal </h2>
      <h4>My goal was to be more efficient with homework, as earlier in the year, I noticed that I was procrasinating a lot, especially with History annotations. I have become much more efficient, as you will see in my History page! I have improved a lot since th ebeginning of the year. </h4>
      
      <h2> Reflection </h2>
      
      <p> How broad is your friend group? Are peers easily accepted (within your group and /or outside of your group)? What have you done/can you do to improve the social atmosphere within your group of friends, grade-level, or school?</p>
      
     <h4>1. I do have about three really close best friends that I hang out with at school. And then I also have friends that I hang out with after school. Peers are easily acceoted into our friends group. We let anyone sit with us at lunch and are open to new friendships. We have also invited people to sit with us. </h4> 
      

      <p> How have you contributed to our community this year? Provide examples of any leadership roles you have assumed or how you have been a role model (these examples of any leadership roles from extracurricular activities). How have you grown as a leader/role model, or what are some ideas on how to assume these roles in the future? </p>
      <h4>2. I did run for a student council position this year/ I feel like now hat I have been at the school for two years, I'm not that shy anymore and I feel like I, now as an 8th grader, can set a good example for the 7th and 6th graders. </h4>
      
      <p> Are you consistant with completing work on work on time? What is hindering/helping you? </p>
      
      <h4>3. I am consistant with comnpleting work on time. I want to get into the habit of doing this for High school. I think the fact that I want to get into a specific college when I'm older is motivating me to work hard. I also just want to do it for me Only I am benefiting from this, so why waste time and money? I think that I am most proud of my Literature essays and my History annotations, In my old school, we didnt write essays or annotations, we only did narratives. So I never was really taught the basics of essay writing. I also think I have inproved in writing history annotations. i'd never done anything like that until thsi year, and I feel like, even though it took me a while, that I've finally started to get the hang of it. I think that now, some Habits of Mind that are easily identifiable in these piieces re that I'm thinking more Flexibly, for example, I'm approproaching problems from differnt angels and eprspectivesb(especially after we did the questions forchapter 5 and 6 in The odyssey. That   really helped). I feel like it also shows that now, I'm striving for Accuracy and precision. </h4>
