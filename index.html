      <h2> My Stretch</h2>
      <h4> This year, my stretch was to learn more vocabulary. And my strength was taking good notes. It has helped me a lot. Especially on essays. Also, my notes for Literature has helped me to study for upcoming tests, as I took a lot of notes while we were reading. I also have a feeling that my notes from History will help me later, as it is required that a highschooler takes US History. And if I am ever confused, I can just look back at my notes! </h4>
      
    
      <h2> My Strength </h2>
<h4> My stretch was learning more vocabulary words everyday. learn three vocabulary words every day. It did take me a while to find an efficient way to memorize words, but now, I've got that down! This week I have memorized prodigal, voltile, vindicate, and zealot! </h4>
      
      
      <h2> My Goal </h2>
      <h4>My goal was to be more efficient with homework, as earlier in the year, I noticed that I was procrasinating a lot, especially with History annotations. I have become much more efficient, as you will see in my History page! I have improved a lot since th ebeginning of the year. </h4>
