        <p> It’s a fun mix of both llamas and great views! It was also very fun to see the old ruins of the Incas! </p>

    <p> Although I wasn’t able to swim in the Blue Lagoon, we drove there and I was able to see it from up above!

      Seeing this was absolutely amazing! The fact that the Incas were able to shape and not to mention, carry, these large bolders. The pyramids that the Egyptians built were made out of sandstone, while these are made out of rock. Visting this place on my trip in Peru was fascinating and it made me realize how interesting the Incas are, especially due to the fact that they were able to shape these giant boulders were just barely any tools!
